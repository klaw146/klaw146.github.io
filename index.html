        <h2>Welcome</h2>
          <p>
            If you're looking for high quality, hand-crafted juggling and circus
            products, the J-Prop Shop is the store for you. I've designed and built
            props for the past 35 years, and my products have been used by
            professional entertainers and hobbyists through the world. Our prices are
            reasonable and our quality is excellent.

        <h2>Specials This Month</h2>
          <p>
            The following devil sticks are available at a discount for the entire month
            of May:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Basic Stick ($19.95)</strong>
              The easiest stick to learn with, but "grippy" enough for most demanding
              tricks. Comes in red, green, and blue.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Flower Stick ($24.95)</strong>
              A graceful stick with colored tassels. Flower Sticks float slowly, making them
              ideal for beginners.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Master Stick ($39.95)</strong>
              Our most popular stick is shorter and heavier for fast play and more advanced
              tricks. Each Master Stick is available in custom colors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Glow Stick ($29.95)</strong>
              The Glow Stick shines brightly at night (without the danger of a fire stick).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Quality Tested</h2>
        <p>
          Every item I created is checked and tested before being shipped out to assure
          perfect quality. I take pride in ever one of my juggling props and I want my
          customers to feel the same pride.

          years ago and I was immediately impressed by his craftsmanship. He provides
